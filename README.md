# de_int_fi
This is the numerical integration program for Fourier-type integrals, using double exponential transformation. 
I made this for integrate complex function which has singular point.

### usage of example code
 1. type 'make' command to compile.
 2. type './example.out' to run.

Please see de_int_fi.h for detail of functions, example.c for detail of function usages.
